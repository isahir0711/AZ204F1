## Todo:

- Create Github repo
- Deploy into Azure
- Delete blobs based on created/lastmodified property
- Implement different type of triggers (in this case operations using the BlobStorage trigger when a blob its uploaded)
- Create function that process the image after the upload or change a value, etc
